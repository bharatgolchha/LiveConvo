# Summary Generation Fix Test Plan

## Issues Fixed

1. **Real-time summary not being saved to summaries table**
   - Added `/api/sessions/[id]/complete` endpoint to save real-time summaries to the summaries table
   - Modified stop recording flow to call this endpoint

2. **Summary fields not being properly mapped**
   - Enhanced field mapping in finalize route to handle both camelCase and snake_case fields
   - Added fallback values for empty arrays to ensure data is always present

3. **Summary display page not loading from summaries table**
   - Updated summary page to prioritize data from summaries table over realtime_summary_cache
   - Fixed field mapping to handle both database formats

4. **Enhanced error logging**
   - Added detailed validation and error logging in finalize route
   - Better error messages for debugging database issues

## Test Steps

### 1. Test Real-time Summary Save
1. Start a new recording
2. Record for at least 2 minutes to generate content
3. Stop recording (without going to finalize)
4. Check browser console for:
   - "ðŸ’¾ Creating final summary in summaries table..."
   - "âœ… Final summary created with ID: [id]"
5. Navigate to the summary page
6. Verify all fields are displayed:
   - TL;DR
   - Key Points
   - Decisions (if any)
   - Action Items (if any)

### 2. Test Finalize Flow
1. Start a new recording
2. Record content
3. Click "End & Summarize"
4. Complete the finalization form
5. Check console for successful summary save
6. Verify summary page shows enhanced analysis

### 3. Database Verification
Run these queries to verify data:

```sql
-- Check latest summaries
SELECT 
    s.id,
    s.session_id,
    s.title,
    LENGTH(s.tldr) as tldr_length,
    jsonb_array_length(COALESCE(s.key_decisions, '[]'::jsonb)) as decisions_count,
    jsonb_array_length(COALESCE(s.action_items, '[]'::jsonb)) as action_items_count,
    s.generation_status,
    s.created_at
FROM summaries s
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check sessions with both cache and summary
SELECT 
    sess.id,
    sess.title,
    sess.realtime_summary_cache IS NOT NULL as has_cache,
    summ.id IS NOT NULL as has_summary
FROM sessions sess
LEFT JOIN summaries summ ON summ.session_id = sess.id
WHERE sess.status = 'completed'
ORDER BY sess.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Fix Existing Sessions
For any existing sessions missing summaries, run:

```sql
-- First check what needs fixing
SELECT 
    s.id,
    s.title,
    s.realtime_summary_cache->>'tldr' as cached_tldr
FROM sessions s
LEFT JOIN summaries sm ON sm.session_id = s.id
WHERE s.status = 'completed'
  AND s.realtime_summary_cache IS NOT NULL
  AND sm.id IS NULL;
```

Then manually create summaries for those sessions using the `/api/sessions/[id]/complete` endpoint.

## Expected Results

After the fixes:
1. Every completed session should have an entry in the summaries table
2. Summary page should display all fields properly:
   - TL;DR
   - Key Points (conversation_highlights)
   - Decisions (key_decisions)
   - Action Items
   - Follow-up Questions
3. No more "undefined" or empty fields in the summary display
4. Enhanced summaries from finalize flow should include:
   - Insights
   - Performance metrics
   - Coaching recommendations
   - Success indicators

## Troubleshooting

If summaries are still not displaying:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check network tab for API responses
3. Verify session has `summaries` data in `/api/sessions/[id]` response
4. Check database for summary record
5. Ensure all JSONB fields are properly formatted arrays, not null
