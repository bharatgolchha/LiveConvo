### 🔧 Bug Fixes & Issues

- [x] **🚨 Fix Minute Tracking Issues - Complete** (2025-06-05) 🚨 **JUST FIXED**
  - **Issue**: Database trigger was counting every `usage_tracking` insert as 1 full minute, regardless of actual `seconds_recorded` value. This caused massive over-counting when users start/stop recording repeatedly.
  - **Example**: User with 46 seconds of actual recording was showing 26 minutes used (26 separate 2-second recordings = 26 minutes incorrectly counted)
  - **Root Cause**: The `update_member_usage()` trigger function was using `+ 1` minute for every insert instead of calculating based on actual seconds recorded
  - **Solution Implemented**:
    - ✅ **Accurate Seconds-to-Minutes Conversion**: Modified trigger to use `CEIL(total_seconds / 60.0)` instead of always adding 1 minute
    - ✅ **Proper Incremental Calculation**: Only increment minutes by the difference between new total and old total 
    - ✅ **Fixed Monthly Cache Logic**: Fetch existing totals, add new seconds, recalculate minutes accurately
    - ✅ **Corrected Organization Members Sync**: Both tables now stay in perfect sync with accurate calculations
    - ✅ **Data Correction Migration**: Fixed all existing incorrect data by recalculating from actual usage_tracking records
  - **Technical Details**:
    - Updated trigger function to fetch existing monthly totals before calculating new values
    - Changed from `+ 1` minute to `minute_increment = new_minutes - old_minutes`
    - Fixed total_audio_hours_used calculation to use actual seconds: `seconds_recorded / 3600.0`
    - Added comprehensive data correction to fix historical over-counting
  - **Results**: 
    - ✅ Test user went from 26 minutes (incorrect) to 1 minute (correct) for 46 seconds of recording
    - ✅ New recordings properly increment only by actual time used
    - ✅ Minute boundaries handled correctly (120 seconds = 2 minutes, 121 seconds = 3 minutes)
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Minute tracking now accurately reflects actual recording time

- [x] **🚨 Fix Usage Limit False Positive Bug** (2025-01-30) 🚨 **JUST FIXED**
  - **Issue**: Recording was automatically stopping with "Usage limit reached" message even when user had minutes remaining
  - **Root Cause**: The `useMinuteTracking` hook was initialized with `monthlyMinutesLimit: 0` and `minutesRemaining: 0` in the initial state, causing any usage to immediately trigger the limit reached callback
  - **Solution**: 
    - ✅ Fixed initial state to use reasonable defaults (`monthlyMinutesLimit: 600`, `minutesRemaining: 600`)
    - ✅ Added debugging logs to track when and why limit checks are triggered
    - ✅ Fixed stale closure issue in `trackMinute` function that was using outdated state values
    - ✅ Improved limit checking logic to use current state values instead of stale references
  - **Technical Details**:
    - Changed initial `monthlyMinutesLimit` from `0` to `600` minutes (10 hours)
    - Changed initial `minutesRemaining` from `0` to `600` minutes
    - Added proper debugging to identify when limits are incorrectly triggered
    - Fixed callback timing to avoid React state update conflicts
  - **Result**: ✅ Users can now record without false positive usage limit stops

- [x] **🔧 Fix Track Minute API 400 Error** (2025-01-30) 🚨 **JUST FIXED**
  - **Issue**: Track minute API returning 400 status with empty error object, causing minute tracking to fail during recording
  - **Root Cause**: Stale closure bug in `useMinuteTracking` hook - the `startTracking` function was using stale `state.currentSessionSeconds` value instead of current state, causing it to repeatedly try to track the same minute instead of incrementing properly
  - **Solution**: Fixed the closure issue by using the updated state value within the `setState` callback instead of referencing the stale outer scope variable
  - **Technical Details**: 
    - Changed `Math.floor(state.currentSessionSeconds / 60)` to use `newSessionSeconds` from the setState callback
    - Consolidated the state updates to avoid multiple setState calls
    - Removed stale dependency from useCallback dependency array
  - **Result**: ✅ Minute tracking now works correctly and doesn't repeatedly attempt to track the same minute

- [x] **🔧 Fix Completed Session Status Reverting to Draft** (2025-01-30) 🚨 **JUST FIXED**
  - **Issue**: When clicking on a finalized conversation with "Done" status from dashboard, the conversation state changes back to "draft" from "completed" when the /app page loads
  - **Root Cause**: App page's session status update effect was automatically changing completed sessions back to 'draft' status in the database when viewing them
  - **Solution**: Modified session status update logic to only update database when actual recording state changes occur, not when just viewing completed sessions
  - **Technical Fix**: 
    - Added `hasLoadedFromStorage.current` check to prevent updates during initial load
    - Added `shouldUpdateStatus` logic to only update on 'recording' or actual 'completed' transitions
    - Removed automatic 'draft' status assignment for viewing sessions
  - **Result**: ✅ Completed sessions now maintain their "Done" status when accessed from dashboard

    - Shadow effects for depth and visual polish
    - Moved MIN_WIDTH, MAX_WIDTH, COLLAPSED_WIDTH constants outside component to prevent useCallback recreation

- [x] **✅ Fix Tab Switching Recording Loss Issue** (2025-01-27) 🚨 **JUST FIXED**
  - **Issue**: When switching tabs and coming back, the browser refreshes and recording stops, making it impossible to record anything effectively
  - **Root Cause**: 
    - Browser tab suspension causing page refreshes and connection drops
    - No protection against accidental page refreshes during recording
    - Deepgram WebSocket connections being terminated when tab becomes inactive
    - Missing recovery mechanisms for connection restoration
    - **KEY ISSUE**: Database loading logic was overriding active recording state when tab became visible again
  - **Solution Implemented**:
    - ✅ **Tab Visibility API Integration**: Added comprehensive tab visibility change handling to detect when tabs are hidden/visible
    - ✅ **Page Refresh Prevention**: Added keyboard shortcuts blocking (Ctrl+R, F5, Cmd+R) during active recording
    - ✅ **Unload Protection**: Added beforeunload event handler to warn users before leaving during active recording

- [x] **✅ Fix Timeline Generation JSON Parsing & Auto-Trigger Issues** (2025-01-27) 🚨 **JUST FIXED**
  - **Issue**: Timeline not being generated automatically due to JSON parsing errors and overly strict generation thresholds
  - **Root Cause**: 
    - AI model (Gemini) was returning malformed JSON with unterminated strings or markdown code blocks
    - Timeline generation thresholds were too high (30 words, 10 new lines) preventing automatic generation
    - Poor error handling led to timeline failures instead of graceful fallbacks
  - **Solution Implemented**:

- [x] **✅ Enhanced Transcript Saving System for Maximum Reliability** (2025-01-27) 🚨 **COMPLETED & VALIDATED**
  - **Issue**: Ensure transcript is saved reliably and frequently, as it's the most critical data (summary and timeline can be regenerated)
  - **Implementation**: Built a comprehensive, multi-layered transcript saving system with redundancy and reliability features
  - **✅ TESTING CONFIRMED**: System working perfectly - auto-saves every 500ms, retries on failure, and provides excellent error handling
  - **Features Implemented**:
    - ✅ **Enhanced Save Function**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 3 retries) for failed saves
    - ✅ **Frequent Auto-Save**: Reduced debounce time from 2000ms to 500ms for more frequent saves  
    - ✅ **Expanded State Coverage**: Saves transcript in 'recording', 'paused', and 'completed' states (previously only recording/completed)
    - ✅ **Immediate State-Change Saves**: Automatically saves when transitioning to paused/completed/error states
    - ✅ **Periodic Backup Saves**: Every 30 seconds during active recording to prevent data loss
    - ✅ **Manual Save Functions**: Added `saveTranscriptNow()` and `handleManualSaveTranscript()` for immediate saves
    - ✅ **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Network failures trigger automatic retries with detailed logging
    - ✅ **Enhanced Finalization**: Ensures transcript is saved before generating final summary
  - **Result**: Transcript data is now saved with maximum frequency and reliability - users can no longer lose their conversation data

- [x] **✅ Fixed Infinite Loop in Summary/Timeline Generation for Loaded Data** (2025-01-27) 🚨 **COMPLETED & VERIFIED**
  - **Issue**: When loading existing transcript data from database, the forced summary and timeline generation was triggering in an infinite loop.
  - **Root Cause**: `useEffect` dependencies, including `fullTranscriptText` and refresh functions, were unstable or being re-created, causing repeated re-execution.
  - **Solution Implemented**:
    - ✅ **Memoized `fullTranscriptText`**: Used `React.useMemo` to stabilize `fullTranscriptText` and prevent it from causing unnecessary re-renders.
    - ✅ **Added Prevention Flag**: Created `hasTriggeredForcedGeneration` (a `useRef` boolean) to ensure the forced generation logic runs only once per appropriate data load.
    - ✅ **Refined Flag Reset Logic**: Ensured `hasTriggeredForcedGeneration` is reset correctly when `conversationId` changes or `conversationState` becomes `recording` or `setup`, allowing the logic to run for new/reset sessions.
    - ✅ **Stabilized Dependencies**: Ensured the main `useEffect` for forcing generation has stable dependencies.
  - **Status**: ✅ **FIXED & VERIFIED LOGICALLY** - The infinite loop is addressed. A separate 500 error on page load is observed, potentially related to Next.js/Turbopack build issues rather than this specific fix.
  - **Technical Details**:
    - Memoizing `fullTranscriptText` ensures its reference stability.
    - The `hasTriggeredForcedGeneration` flag directly controls the execution flow, preventing re-runs for the same loaded data.
    - Resetting the flag is tied to specific state changes that indicate a new context for generation (new session, recording started).

- [x] **✅ Enhanced Summary and Timeline Generation for Loaded Data** (2025-01-27) 🚨 **COMPLETED & VALIDATED**

- [ ] **⚡ Optimize Dashboard Page Performance** (2025-06-17) 🆕 **IN PROGRESS**
  - **Goal**: Reduce initial dashboard bundle size, improve Time-to-Interactive, and enforce file-length guidelines by modularizing code.
  - **Phase 1** (COMPLETED):
    - Extracted `DashboardHeader`, `DashboardSidebar`, `ConversationInboxItem`, `EmptyState`, `ContextUploadWidget`, and `NewConversationModal` into separate client components under `src/components/dashboard/`.
    - Added dynamic imports for `DashboardHeader` + `DashboardSidebar` to enable code-splitting.
    - Cleaned up `dashboard/page.tsx` by commenting out legacy inline components and importing extracted ones.
  - **Phase 2** (COMPLETED):
    - Added edge caching headers to `/api/users/stats-v2` and `/api/users/subscription` endpoints.
    - **Enhanced conversation list UI**: Redesigned `ConversationInboxItem` with modern card design featuring:
      - Compact, space-efficient layout with proper 12px gaps between cards
      - Animated status indicators with pulse effects for live sessions
      - Conversation type icons (💼 sales, 🤝 support, 📋 meeting, etc.)
      - Rich metadata display (duration, word count, linked conversations)
      - Contextual action buttons that appear on hover
      - Beautiful tooltips for linked conversation details
      - Improved visual hierarchy and spacing
      - Dark mode support with proper contrast
      - Reduced card padding and icon sizes for better density
  - **Next**:

    - Convert page to Server Component & stream initial data.
    - Virtualise conversation list.
    - Add cache-control headers to usage and subscription API routes.
  - **Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS – phase 1 merged; continue refactor in follow-up commits.

- [x] **🐛 Fix Conversation Type Null Crash** (2025-06-07) **JUST COMPLETED**
  - **Issue**: Dashboard crashed with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toLowerCase')` when a session had a `null` or undefined `conversation_type`.
  - **Solution Implemented**:
    - Updated `ConversationInboxItem.tsx` to safely handle `null/undefined` conversation types by returning a default icon before calling `toLowerCase()`.
    - Added Jest tests `ConversationInboxItem.test.tsx` to confirm the component renders without crashing and displays the correct icons for `null` and known conversation types.
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Dashboard no longer crashes when `conversation_type` is missing.

### [2025-06-17]

### 2025-06-19: Build Optimized Use-Case Landing Pages
**Status**: 🆕 PLANNING  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Description**: Create dedicated landing pages for core use cases (sales, consulting, recruiting, support, education) as outlined in `landingPage.md`.

**Next Actions**:
1. Design persona-specific hero sections and demo assets.
2. Implement route groups under `src/app/solutions/*` using a shared `LandingTemplate` component.
3. Update `next-sitemap.config.js` and add JSON-LD metadata for each page.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `landingPage.md` (new)

### 2025-08-08: Landing Page Optimization + Upload Feature Messaging
**Status**: 🆕 PLANNING  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Description**: Optimize the main landing page (`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`) for performance, clarity, and conversion. Add clear messaging and CTAs for the Upload capabilities: (1) Upload recordings (offline ingestion that creates a diarized session) and (2) Upload context documents (PDF/DOCX/TXT) to enrich AI guidance.

**Next Actions**:
1. Content & UX
   - Update hero copy to include “Upload a recording or context files — get instant transcripts, summaries, and insights.”
   - Add a dedicated "Upload" section below the hero with two cards: "Upload recording (audio/video)" and "Upload documents (PDF/DOCX/TXT)"; outline benefits and accepted formats.
   - Surface dual CTAs: primary "Start free"; secondary "Try upload demo" (routes to `/test-offline` when logged out; opens `UploadRecordingModal` when authenticated).
2. Integrations
   - Wire hero/section CTAs to: `/signup` (logged out) or dashboard action to open `UploadRecordingModal` (logged in). Link document upload CTAs to the conversation setup sidebar when enabled.
3. Performance
   - Replace CSS background hero image with responsive `next/image`, provide WebP/AVIF, proper `sizes`, and priority hints for LCP.
   - Lazy-load below-the-fold sections; defer non-critical animations; audit bundle and remove unused icons.
   - Preconnect/prefetch critical domains; compress media assets stored in Supabase Storage.
4. SEO
   - Expand JSON-LD in `SeoJsonLd` to include features around file uploads; refine meta title/description; ensure headings reflect Upload value props.
5. Analytics
   - Track upload-related CTA clicks and scroll depth on the new section.
6. QA & Tests
   - Lighthouse/LCP budget check in CI for `/`.
   - Playwright smoke: CTAs route correctly for logged-in/out states.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- Modify: `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` (copy, sections, CTAs, image optimization)
- Modify: `frontend/src/components/SeoJsonLd.tsx` (JSON-LD additions)
- Optional: new `frontend/src/components/landing/UploadFeatureSection.tsx` (modular section)
- Docs: update `docs/landingPage.md` with Upload section content
