## 🔧 Latest Fixes & Updates

### January 27, 2025 - Critical Bug Fixes
- ✅ **Enhanced Transcript Context for AI Services**: Added speaker tags to summary and guidance generation
  - **Improvement**: Now includes "ME:" and "THEM:" speaker tags when sending transcript to AI services
  - **Implementation**:
    - Updated `fullTranscriptText` for summary generation to include speaker context
    - Updated `recentTranscript` for guidance generation to include speaker context
    - Format: "ME: [text]" and "THEM: [text]" instead of plain text
  - **Benefits**: AI can now understand conversation flow and provide more contextual summaries and guidance
  - **Status**: ✅ Both summary and guidance APIs now receive speaker-tagged transcripts

- ✅ **Replaced Auto-Guidance with Manual Button**: Removed automatic guidance generation in favor of on-demand button
  - **Rationale**: Better user control and easier testing/debugging
  - **Implementation**:
    - Removed auto-guidance useEffect hooks (transcript-based and interval-based triggers)
    - Removed auto-guidance trigger from `handleLiveTranscript` function
    - Removed `autoGuidance` state variable and settings checkbox
    - Kept existing "Get Fresh Guidance" button for manual generation

  - **Implementation**: 
    - Added private `customAudioStream` property to store custom audio streams
    - Implemented `setCustomAudioStream(stream: MediaStream)` method in service class
    - Modified `startRecording()` to use custom stream if available, otherwise fallback to microphone
    - Added `setCustomAudioStream` callback to `useDeepgramTranscription` hook return value
  - **Status**: ✅ App page now works with both OpenAI and Deepgram providers without errors
