# LiveConvo - Task Tracker

## 📋 Current Sprint Tasks

### ✅ Completed Tasks

- [x] **✅ Enhanced AI Coach Context Integration & Message Display Fix** (2025-01-29) 🎯
  - **Issue**: AI Coach was not using conversation context effectively - giving generic responses instead of specific guidance
  - **Problem 1**: AI Coach only received basic transcript/conversationType, missing comprehensive context
  - **Problem 2**: Context prefix `[Context: sales - title]` was showing in user message bubbles
  - **Problem 3**: User message text was dark blue on blue background (poor contrast)
  - **Solution**:
    - Enhanced `useChatGuidance` hook to accept comprehensive context (textContext, summary, timeline, files, etc.)
    - Updated chat guidance API to build rich context prompts with background notes, summary, timeline, files
    - Added `parseMessageForDisplay()` function to strip context prefix from user messages in chat UI
    - Fixed user message text color to be white on blue background for better readability
    - Enhanced system prompt to be highly context-aware and reference user's specific situation
  - **Result**: ✅ AI Coach now provides contextual, specific guidance using all conversation data
    - When user asks "What am I selling?" - AI references their specific product/service from background notes
    - AI Coach understands conversation type, timeline events, summary, and uploaded documents
    - Message UI clean with proper contrast and no context prefix showing
    - Context automatically included in all guidance requests for relevant, actionable advice

- [x] **✅ RESOLVED: Complete Database Setup Successfully Deployed** (2025-01-29) 🎉

  - **Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY to Supabase database

- [x] **Critical Database Fix: Missing session_context Table** (2025-01-29) 🔧
  - **Root Cause**: session_context table was defined in schema.md but missing from actual supabase_schema.sql
  - **Symptoms**: 500 errors when saving context data through /api/sessions/[id]/context endpoint
  - **Solution**: Added complete session_context table definition to supabase_schema.sql
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Added session_context table with proper columns (id, session_id, user_id, organization_id, text_context, context_metadata, etc.)
    - Added proper indexes for performance (session_id, user_id, organization_id, processing_status)
    - Added update trigger for automatic updated_at timestamp management
    - Added RLS (Row Level Security) policies for proper data access control
    - Created migration script (create_session_context_table.sql) for safe table creation

## 🔧 Latest Fixes & Updates

### January 27, 2025 - Critical Bug Fixes
- ✅ **Enhanced Transcript Context for AI Services**: Added speaker tags to summary and guidance generation
  - **Improvement**: Now includes "ME:" and "THEM:" speaker tags when sending transcript to AI services
  - **Implementation**:
    - Updated `fullTranscriptText` for summary generation to include speaker context
    - Updated `recentTranscript` for guidance generation to include speaker context
    - Format: "ME: [text]" and "THEM: [text]" instead of plain text
  - **Benefits**: AI can now understand conversation flow and provide more contextual summaries and guidance
  - **Status**: ✅ Both summary and guidance APIs now receive speaker-tagged transcripts

- ✅ **Replaced Auto-Guidance with Manual Button**: Removed automatic guidance generation in favor of on-demand button
  - **Rationale**: Better user control and easier testing/debugging
  - **Implementation**:
    - Removed auto-guidance useEffect hooks (transcript-based and interval-based triggers)
    - Removed auto-guidance trigger from `handleLiveTranscript` function
    - Removed `autoGuidance` state variable and settings checkbox
    - Kept existing "Get Fresh Guidance" button for manual generation
    - Cleaned up unused variables (`lastGuidanceIndex`)
  - **Status**: ✅ Guidance now generates only when user clicks the button
  - **UI Location**: "Get Fresh Guidance" button appears at bottom of Guidance panel when transcript exists

- ✅ **Fixed setCustomAudioStream Error in Deepgram Integration**: Resolved `TypeError: setThemAudioStream is not a function` in app page
  - **Root Cause**: Deepgram transcription hook was missing `setCustomAudioStream` function that exists in OpenAI/WebRTC hook
  - **Solution**: Added `setCustomAudioStream` method to `DeepgramTranscriptionService` class
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Added private `customAudioStream` property to store custom audio streams
    - Implemented `setCustomAudioStream(stream: MediaStream)` method in service class
    - Modified `startRecording()` to use custom stream if available, otherwise fallback to microphone
    - Added `setCustomAudioStream` callback to `useDeepgramTranscription` hook return value
  - **Status**: ✅ App page now works with both OpenAI and Deepgram providers without errors
  - **Testing**: Verified that system audio capture (for "them" audio) now works correctly with Deepgram

- ✅ **Fixed Deepgram Connection Timing Issues**: Resolved race condition where recording started before WebSocket connection was fully established
  - Updated `connect()` method to properly wait for connection events
  - Added connection timeout handling (10s) with proper error handling
  - Modified `startRecording()` to ensure connection is established before proceeding
  - Added processing state during connection establishment

- ✅ **Fixed Guidance Interval Timer Loop**: Eliminated infinite loop in guidance generation timer 
  - Removed circular dependencies in useEffect by inlining guidance generation
  - Changed dependency array to prevent constant re-creation of intervals
  - Added timeout buffer to prevent immediate re-triggers

- ✅ **Fixed TypeScript Linting Errors**: Added proper type annotations to test callback parameters
  - Fixed 8 TypeScript linting errors in deepgramTranscription.test.ts
  - All 23 Deepgram integration tests continue to pass

- ✅ **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error messages and connection state management
  - Added detailed error messages with context
  - Improved logging for debugging connection issues
  - Better state management during recording startup

- ✅ **Development Server Status**: Confirmed working on ports 3000 and 3002 with all fixes applied
  - Next.js server running stable with Turbopack
  - All major console errors resolved
  - Ready for user testing and development

**Next Steps**: Continue with feature development - all blocking issues resolved.
