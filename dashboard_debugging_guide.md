# Dashboard Debugging Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Import Error in /api/dashboard/data**
   - Fixed the import statement to properly import supabase and helper functions

2. **Authentication Race Condition**
   - Updated useEffect dependencies to prevent multiple fetches
   - Added proper checks for session token before making API calls

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added comprehensive error logging to identify issues
   - Fixed the onboarding check to prevent infinite loops

## How to Debug

1. **Check the Browser Console**
   - Look for messages starting with "Dashboard:" to track the data flow
   - Check for "Dashboard API response status:" to see if the API is responding
   - Look for any 500 errors

2. **Test the API Directly**
   - Open `/api/test` in your browser - it should return a JSON response with status "ok"
   - Check if Supabase environment variables are configured

3. **Common Issues**
   - **No sessions showing**: Check if the user has completed onboarding
   - **500 errors**: Usually means server-side configuration issues
   - **401 errors**: Authentication token is missing or expired

## Next Steps

1. Refresh your browser and check the console logs
2. If you see a 500 error, check the server logs for the specific error
3. Verify your Supabase configuration in `.env.local`
4. Make sure you're logged in with a valid user account

## Quick Fixes

If the dashboard is still not loading:

1. Clear your browser cache and cookies
2. Log out and log back in
3. Check if the user has a `current_organization_id` set in the database
4. Verify the Supabase service role key is configured for server-side queries
