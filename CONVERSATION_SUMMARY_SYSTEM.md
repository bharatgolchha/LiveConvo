# LiveConvo Conversation Summary System

## Overview

The LiveConvo Conversation Summary System is designed to provide intelligent, context-aware summaries that can handle both individual conversation sessions and multi-session conversation chains. This system maintains conversation continuity across multiple related sessions while providing progressively more intelligent insights as conversations evolve.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

1. **Intelligent Summary Generation**: Provide comprehensive summaries within 30 seconds of session completion
2. **Conversation Continuity**: Maintain context across related conversation sessions
3. **Progressive Intelligence**: Each session builds on previous conversation history
4. **Action Item Tracking**: Monitor completion and progress of tasks across sessions
5. **Evolution Analysis**: Track how conversations and relationships develop over time

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Database Design

#### Conversation Chains
```sql
-- Manages multi-session conversations
conversation_chains (
    id,                         -- UUID primary key
    user_id,                    -- Owner of the conversation chain
    title,                      -- Human-readable chain title
    conversation_type,          -- 'sales_call', 'interview', 'meeting', etc.
    status,                     -- 'active', 'completed', 'archived'
    total_sessions,             -- Count of sessions in this chain
    shared_context,             -- Persistent context across sessions
    participant_names,          -- JSONB array of participants
    key_topics                  -- JSONB array of main topics
)
```

#### Enhanced Sessions
```sql
-- Individual conversation sessions with chain linking
sessions (
    -- Standard fields...
    conversation_chain_id,      -- Link to conversation chain
    parent_session_id,          -- Direct parent session reference
    session_sequence_number     -- Order within conversation chain
)
```

#### Smart Summaries
```sql
-- Multi-type summaries with context awareness
summaries (
    -- Standard fields...
    summary_type,               -- 'session', 'chain', 'cumulative'
    includes_previous_sessions, -- Whether context from previous sessions is included
    session_range_start,        -- First session sequence included
    session_range_end,          -- Last session sequence included
    
    -- Context tracking
    previous_session_references, -- JSONB links to relevant previous content
    carry_forward_items,        -- JSONB action items from previous sessions
    context_continuity_score,   -- AI-calculated continuity score (0-1)
    
    -- Evolution tracking
    progress_since_last_session, -- What changed/progressed
    new_topics_introduced,      -- JSONB new topics not in previous sessions
    recurring_themes            -- JSONB themes across multiple sessions
)
```

## 📋 Summary Types

### 1. Session Summary
**Generated**: After each individual session ends  
**Purpose**: Standard summary of a single conversation  
**Content**:
- TL;DR of the session
- Key decisions made
- Action items assigned
- Follow-up questions
- Session-specific insights

**Timing**: Generated within 30 seconds of session completion

### 2. Chain Summary
**Generated**: Periodically for ongoing conversation chains (every 3 sessions by default)  
**Purpose**: Aggregate insights across multiple sessions  
**Content**:
- Overall conversation arc and progress
- Cumulative decisions and outcomes
- Long-term action item tracking
- Relationship and trust evolution
- Recurring themes and patterns

**Timing**: Generated automatically when chain reaches milestones

### 3. Cumulative Summary
**Generated**: When starting a new session that continues a previous conversation  
**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive context for the upcoming session  
**Content**:
- Summary of previous sessions (configurable window: 1-5 sessions)
- Outstanding action items and commitments
- Key decisions that remain relevant
- Participant context and relationship status
- Suggested topics or follow-ups

**Timing**: Generated before session start when continuation is detected

## 🔄 User Workflows

### Starting a New Conversation
```
1. User clicks "New Conversation"
2. System checks for related previous conversations
3. If continuation detected:
   a. Link to existing conversation chain OR create new chain
   b. Generate cumulative summary with context
   c. Pre-populate context with relevant information
4. If new conversation:
   a. Create new session (potentially new chain)
   b. Standard session setup
```

### During a Conversation
```
1. AI guidance considers full conversation chain context
2. Real-time suggestions reference previous session insights
3. Action items automatically link to previous commitments
4. Progress tracking updates based on previous session goals
```

### After a Conversation
```
1. Generate session summary (standard 30-second SLA)
2. Update conversation chain statistics
3. Check for chain milestone (every N sessions)
4. If milestone: Generate chain summary
5. Update action item statuses across chain
6. Calculate context continuity score
```

### Viewing Summaries
```
1. Session summaries show individual conversation insights
2. Chain summaries show conversation evolution
3. Export options include:
   - Single session summary
   - Multi-session conversation history
   - Action item reports across sessions
   - Progress tracking reports
```

## 🤖 AI Integration Points

### Context Window Management
- **Smart Context Selection**: Prioritize recent sessions but include key decisions from entire chain
- **Token Optimization**: Balance context richness with API cost efficiency
- **Relevance Scoring**: Use semantic similarity to identify most relevant previous content

### Continuity Scoring Algorithm
```python
def calculate_continuity_score(current_session, previous_sessions):
    """
    Calculate how well conversation context was maintained (0-1 score)
    
    Factors:
    - Reference to previous action items (weight: 0.3)
    - Acknowledgment of previous decisions (weight: 0.25)
    - Participant consistency (weight: 0.2)
    - Topic relevance to previous sessions (weight: 0.15)
    - Follow-up on previous questions (weight: 0.1)
    """
    pass
```

### Evolution Tracking
- **Progress Detection**: Identify what moved forward since last session
- **Theme Analysis**: Track recurring topics and concerns across sessions
- **Relationship Mapping**: Understand how relationships and trust evolve
- **Decision Genealogy**: Trace how decisions build on previous conversations
