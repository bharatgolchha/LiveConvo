# AI Coach Read-Only Mode Implementation

## Overview
Implemented detection and handling for viewing finalized/completed conversations in the AI Coach sidebar to prevent users from interacting with the AI coach after a conversation has ended.

## Changes Made

### 1. Detection of Finalized Conversations
- Added `isViewingFinalized` and `isReadOnly` variables that detect when `conversationState === 'completed'`
- This state is set when:
  - A conversation is finalized via "End & Summarize"
  - Viewing a completed session from the dashboard

### 2. Disabled Interactions

#### Chat Messaging
- `handleSendMessage` now shows a toast notification when trying to send messages in read-only mode
- Message input area is replaced with "This conversation has ended" message
- Send button is disabled

#### Guidance Chips
- All guidance chip buttons are disabled with `opacity-50` and `cursor-not-allowed` styles
- Chips cannot be clicked to populate the message input
- Chip generation is prevented on component mount for completed conversations

#### Auto-Guidance
- Auto-guidance button is not shown for completed conversations
- Refresh chips button is disabled with appropriate tooltip

#### Add to Checklist
- "Generate checklist" button is hidden for AI messages in completed conversations

### 3. Visual Indicators

#### Header
- Shows "Read Only" badge instead of recording status
- Removed live status indicators (recording time, status dot)

#### Empty State
- Changed message from "Start recording to get AI guidance" to "Conversation Complete"
- Subtext: "View the summary and timeline for insights"

#### Quick Help Section
- Title changes from "Live/Preparation [Type] Help" to "Conversation Complete"
- No longer shows "AI generating..." indicator

## Implementation Details

### Key Code Changes in `AICoachSidebar.tsx`:

1. **State Detection** (lines 87-89):
```typescript
const isViewingFinalized = conversationState === 'completed';
const isReadOnly = isViewingFinalized;
```

2. **Prevent Message Sending** (lines 410-415):
```typescript
if (isReadOnly) {
  toast.info('This conversation has ended', {
    description: 'You cannot send messages to completed conversations'
  });
  return;
}
```

3. **Disable UI Elements**:
- Guidance chips: `disabled={isReadOnly}` with styling
- Refresh button: `disabled={isGeneratingChips || isReadOnly}`
- Input area: Replaced with read-only message

4. **Conditional Rendering**:
- Header badge: Shows "Read Only" instead of status
- Empty state: Different messaging for completed conversations
- Add to checklist: Hidden via `&& !isReadOnly` condition

## Testing Approach

Created comprehensive test suite covering:
- Read-only badge display
- Disabled guidance chips
- Message sending prevention
- UI element states
- Different conversation states (ready, recording, paused, completed)

## User Experience

When viewing a finalized conversation:
1. AI Coach sidebar clearly indicates read-only state
2. All interactive elements are visually disabled
3. Attempting interactions shows informative messages
4. Focus is directed to viewing summary and timeline data
5. Historical AI guidance messages remain visible

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Show historical guidance that was provided during the conversation
2. Add ability to export AI coach conversation history
3. Provide a summary of AI guidance effectiveness
4. Allow viewing guidance analytics for completed sessions
