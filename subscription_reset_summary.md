# Subscription Sync Fix Summary

## Issue
When user bgolchha+4@gmail.com signed up for a Pro plan, the subscription was created correctly but their minute limits weren't updated. The dashboard showed 30 minutes (free plan) instead of 420 minutes (7 hours for Pro plan).

## Root Cause
The issue was that the `organization_members` table wasn't being updated when a subscription was created via Stripe webhook. The subscription record was created correctly, but the user's monthly_audio_hours_limit remained at 1 hour (60 minutes) instead of being updated to 7 hours (420 minutes) for the Pro plan.

## Fix Applied

1. **Immediate Fix**: Updated the organization_members record for bgolchha+4@gmail.com to have the correct 7-hour limit.

2. **Database Trigger**: Created a `sync_subscription_limits` trigger that automatically updates organization_members and organizations tables when a subscription is created or updated.

3. **Webhook Handler Update**: Enhanced the Stripe webhook handler to explicitly sync organization member limits when processing subscription events.

4. **Bulk Fix**: Updated all existing active subscriptions to ensure their organization_members records have the correct limits.

## Verification
The user now has:
- 420 minutes (7 hours) monthly limit
- 4 minutes used so far
- 416 minutes remaining
- Pro plan correctly assigned

## Future Prevention
- Database trigger ensures automatic syncing
- Webhook handler has explicit sync logic as backup
- All new subscriptions will automatically update limits

## Files Modified
- `/fix_subscription_sync.sql` - SQL migration with fixes
- `/supabase/functions/stripe-webhooks/index.ts` - Enhanced webhook handler

The issue is now resolved and the user should see the correct 420 minutes limit in their dashboard.
