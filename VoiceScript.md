## Introduction (30 seconds)

"Welcome to LivePrompt.ai - your AI-powered conversation coach that provides real-time guidance during live meetings. 

Today, I'll demonstrate how LivePrompt transforms your meetings with instant transcription, contextual AI suggestions, and comprehensive summaries - all happening in real-time with less than 2-second latency.

Whether you're in sales calls, customer interviews, or team meetings, LivePrompt acts as your intelligent co-pilot, helping you navigate conversations more effectively."

## Meeting Dashboard Overview (45 seconds)

"Let's start at the dashboard. Here you can see all your meetings organized chronologically. Notice how each meeting card shows:
- The meeting title and platform icon
- Duration and date
- A snippet of the AI-generated summary
- Quick access to view or export the meeting

The dashboard also tracks your usage - you can see your remaining bot minutes for recordings and how many meetings you've conducted this month.

To get started with a new meeting, simply click the 'New Meeting' button in the top right."

## Creating a Meeting (1 minute)

"Creating a meeting is a simple 3-step process:

**Step 1: Meeting Basics**
First, give your meeting a meaningful title. For this demo, let's call it 'Q4 Product Roadmap Discussion'.

**Step 2: Context & Agenda**
Here's where LivePrompt gets powerful. You can add context about what you want to achieve. Let me type:
'Discussing Q4 product priorities, need to align on mobile app features and timeline. Key decisions needed on payment integration and user onboarding flow.'

You can also link previous meetings for continuity. Let me select our last product meeting from two weeks ago - LivePrompt will automatically reference this context during our conversation.

**Step 3: Meeting Details**
If you want to record your meeting, paste your meeting URL here. LivePrompt automatically detects whether it's Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams. I'll paste a Zoom link.

Click 'Start Meeting' and we're ready to go!"

## Meeting Interface Tour (1.5 minutes)

"Welcome to the meeting interface - this is where the magic happens. Let me walk you through each component:

**The Header**
At the top, you see your meeting title, the platform indicator, and if we start recording, a live timer showing the duration. The pulsing dot indicates active recording.

**The Conversation Panel (Left Side)**
This is your main workspace with five tabs:

1. **Live Transcript** - Shows real-time transcription with speaker identification
2. **Summary** - An AI-generated summary that updates every few messages
3. **Smart Notes** - Key points and action items extracted automatically
4. **Previous Meetings** - Quick access to linked meeting context
5. **Recording** - Video playback once the meeting ends

**The AI Advisor Panel (Right Side)**
Your AI co-pilot lives here with three powerful features:

1. **AI Chat** - Ask questions or get guidance in real-time
2. **Smart Suggestions** - Context-aware prompts that update based on your conversation
3. **Insights** - Real-time analytics about your meeting

You can resize these panels by dragging the divider, or minimize the AI Advisor for more transcript space."

## Starting a Recording (1 minute)

"To begin recording, click 'Start Recording' in the header. 

LivePrompt checks your available bot minutes - each plan includes a monthly allocation. Our AI bot will join your meeting within 30 seconds.

Watch the status indicator - it shows 'Joining meeting' with a progress animation. Once the bot successfully joins, it changes to 'Recording' with a pulsing indicator.

*[Wait for bot to join]*

Perfect! The bot is now in the meeting. You'll see transcription begin to appear in real-time in the Live Transcript tab. Notice how it identifies different speakers and timestamps each message."

## Real-Time Features Demo (2 minutes)

"Now let me show you the real-time features in action. As I speak, watch how:

**Live Transcription**
Every word appears in the transcript within seconds. The system identifies me as Speaker 1 and timestamps each segment. If someone else joins and speaks, they'll be labeled as Speaker 2, and so on.

**Smart Suggestions**
Look at the AI Advisor panel - the Smart Suggestions tab is already populating with contextual prompts. These aren't generic - they're based on our actual conversation. For example:
- 'What are the key risks we should consider for the payment integration?'
- 'Can you summarize the main points discussed so far?'
- 'What questions should I ask about the timeline?'

Click any suggestion to instantly send it to the AI chat.

**Real-Time Summary**
Switch to the Summary tab - notice it's already generating a summary of our discussion. This updates incrementally every 10 messages, so you always have an up-to-date overview without waiting until the end.

**Smart Notes**
The Smart Notes tab extracts key decisions, action items, and important points. These are perfect for follow-up emails or task tracking."

## AI Advisor Interaction (1.5 minutes)

"Let me demonstrate the AI Advisor's capabilities. I'll click on this smart suggestion: 'What are the main technical challenges for mobile app development?'

Watch the AI Chat - it instantly provides relevant guidance based on:
- Our current conversation context
- The linked previous meeting about product planning
- My personal context from dashboard settings

The response is specific and actionable. I can ask follow-up questions like: 'How should I prioritize these challenges?'

Notice the AI references both our current discussion and the previous meeting context. This continuity is incredibly powerful for multi-meeting projects.

If the suggestions get cluttered, I can clear the chat history while maintaining context awareness."

## Meeting Management Features (1 minute)

"While in a meeting, you have several management options:

**Meeting Settings**
Click the gear icon to access settings where you can:
- Update the meeting title
- Modify the agenda
- Change notification preferences

**Export Options**
The export menu offers multiple formats:
- PDF for formal documentation

**End Meeting**
When you're done, click 'End Meeting'. This:

"LivePrompt includes several advanced features:

**Previous Meeting Context**
In the Previous Meetings tab, you can browse linked meetings and even ask the AI about them. For example: 'What did we decide about authentication in the last meeting?'

**Personal Context Integration**
Your role and preferences from dashboard settings automatically inform the AI's guidance. If you're a product manager, you'll get PM-specific suggestions.

The Insights tab shows real-time analytics:
