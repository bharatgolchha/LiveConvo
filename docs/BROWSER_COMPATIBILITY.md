# Browser Compatibility Notice Implementation

## Overview

A browser compatibility notice system has been implemented to ensure users are aware when they're using a browser that may not fully support all features of liveprompt.ai, particularly the real-time audio and WebRTC features.

## Features

### 1. Browser Detection
The system detects:
- Browser type (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
- Browser version
- WebRTC support
- getUserMedia API support

### 2. Compatibility Warnings
Warnings are shown for:
- **Firefox**: Limited real-time audio feature support
- **Safari**: Some audio features may have limited functionality
- **Outdated browsers**: Chrome/Edge versions older than v90
- **Missing WebRTC**: Browsers without WebRTC or getUserMedia support
- **Unknown browsers**: Other browsers that may not be fully compatible

### 3. User Experience
- **Non-intrusive**: Alert appears at the top of the page
- **Dismissible**: Users can close the notice with an X button
- **Session persistence**: Once dismissed, won't show again during the session
- **Styled consistently**: Uses the app's alert component with warning variant

## Technical Implementation

### Components

1. **`BrowserCompatibilityNotice.tsx`**
   - Main component that displays the compatibility warning
   - Uses session storage to track dismissal
   - Positioned fixed at top of page

2. **`browserUtils.ts`**
   - Utility functions for browser detection
   - `detectBrowser()`: Returns detailed browser information
   - `getBrowserRecommendation()`: Returns appropriate warning message

3. **Alert Component Enhancement**
   - Added `warning` variant to the alert component
   - Yellow color scheme for visibility without being alarming

### Integration

The notice is integrated into the app layout (`app/layout.tsx`) so it appears on all pages when needed.

## Supported Browsers

### Fully Supported
- Google Chrome v90+
- Microsoft Edge v90+

### Limited Support
- Firefox (all versions) - may have audio feature limitations
- Safari (all versions) - some features may not work properly
- Older Chrome/Edge versions - update recommended

### Not Supported
- Browsers without WebRTC support
- Browsers without getUserMedia API

## Testing

Comprehensive tests are included:
- Browser detection accuracy
- Recommendation message generation
- Component rendering and dismissal
- Session storage functionality

## Usage

The browser compatibility check runs automatically when users visit the site. No configuration is needed.

To manually check browser compatibility in your code:

```typescript
import { detectBrowser } from '@/lib/browserUtils';

const browserInfo = detectBrowser();
if (!browserInfo.isSupported) {
  // Handle unsupported browser
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add browser-specific feature flags
2. Provide fallback options for unsupported features
3. Add analytics to track browser usage
4. Include mobile browser detection
5. Add download links for recommended browsers
