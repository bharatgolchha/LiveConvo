# Meeting Linking & Context - The Power of Connected Conversations

One of LivePrompt.ai's most powerful features is the ability to link meetings together, creating a continuous thread of context that makes every conversation more intelligent and productive.

## Why Meeting Context Matters

Traditional meeting tools treat each conversation as an isolated event. LivePrompt.ai revolutionizes this by creating an interconnected web of knowledge that grows smarter over time.

### The Problem with Isolated Meetings
- Starting from scratch each time
- Forgetting previous commitments
- Losing track of decisions
- Repeating discussions
- Missing follow-through

### The LivePrompt.ai Solution
- Continuous context across meetings
- Automatic commitment tracking
- Decision history at your fingertips
- Progressive conversations
- Accountability built-in

## How Meeting Linking Works

### 1. Creating Context Chains

```
Initial Meeting ‚Üí Follow-up ‚Üí Check-in ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Close
       ‚Üì             ‚Üì           ‚Üì          ‚Üì        ‚Üì
    Context      Remembers   Tracks     Analyzes  Complete
    Created      Previous    Progress   Patterns   History
```

### 2. Automatic Context Carryover

When you link meetings, Nova automatically:
- Loads previous transcripts
- Identifies past decisions
- Tracks commitments made
- Recognizes participants

### 3. Intelligent Suggestions

Based on linked meetings, Nova provides:
- "Last time you discussed..."
- "They committed to..."
- "You haven't covered..."
- "This contradicts..."
- "Follow up on..."
