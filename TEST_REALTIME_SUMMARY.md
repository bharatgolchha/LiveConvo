# Real-time Summary Fix Test

## Issues Fixed

1. **Generic summaries being generated**
   - Enhanced the prompt to be more specific and reference actual conversation content
   - Added conversation type context to the system prompt
   - Improved user prompt to request specific details like prices, specs, conditions

2. **Fallback to generic template**
   - Switched back to using `/api/summary` instead of `/api/summary-v2`
   - The summary-v2 endpoint was falling back to generic content too often

3. **Finalize route error**
   - Fixed the params destructuring issue that was causing Turbopack compilation errors

## Expected Behavior

For the MacBook Pro sale conversation, you should now see:

### TL;DR
"Negotiating sale of 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro with i7 processor. Seller asking $1000, buyer countered at $700 due to battery wear (85%), dead pixels, and minor dent."

### Key Points
- 2019 MacBook Pro 16-inch with 6th gen i7 processor and 16GB RAM
- Battery health at 85% with minor dent and 1-2 dead pixels
- Seller initially asking $1000, buyer offered $700 final
- Seller needs to consult boss, call rescheduled for next week

### Action Items
- Seller to discuss $700 offer with boss
- Reschedule call for next week to finalize decision

### Performance Metrics
Should show actual engagement and communication metrics based on the negotiation dynamics.

## To Test

1. Start a new recording
2. Have a conversation about selling something (to trigger sales context)
3. Watch the real-time summary update - it should show specific details
4. Stop recording and check the final summary

## Debugging

If you still see generic summaries:

1. Check browser console for:
   - "ðŸ“Š Summary API Success" - should show actual content
   - Any parsing errors

2. Check the response in Network tab:
   - Look for `/api/summary` calls
   - Check the response has proper JSON structure

3. Verify conversation type is set:
   - Should show "sales" for sales conversations
   - Check in the UI or console logs
