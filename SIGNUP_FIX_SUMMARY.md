# Signup & Onboarding Flow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard API Error
**Problem:** New users got "Dashboard API error: 400" when signing up
**Cause:** Dashboard API was checking `has_completed_onboarding` flag and returning error before redirect

**Solution:** 
- Added proper error handling in `useDashboardData.ts` to detect onboarding required error
- Auto-redirects to `/onboarding` when 400 error with "Setup required" is received

### 2. User Record Creation Failure
**Problem:** User record wasn't being created in public.users table after signup
**Cause:** A problematic trigger `trg_auto_create_org_for_user_smart` was running BEFORE INSERT and trying to create organization membership with a user ID that didn't exist yet (foreign key constraint violation)

**Solution:**
- Removed the problematic `trg_auto_create_org_for_user_smart` trigger
- Fixed the `handle_new_user` trigger to properly create user records
- Ensured user records are created with `has_completed_onboarding: false`

## Database Changes Made

1. **Dropped trigger:** `trg_auto_create_org_for_user_smart` on public.users
   - This trigger was causing foreign key constraint violations
   - Organization creation is now handled properly during onboarding

2. **Updated function:** `handle_new_user()`
   - Ensures user records are created correctly
   - Sets `has_completed_onboarding: false` for new users
   - Has proper error handling to not break auth flow

## Flow After Fix

1. **User Signs Up** 
   - Auth user created in auth.users
   - Trigger creates record in public.users with `has_completed_onboarding: false`

2. **Email Verification**
   - User verifies email
   - Redirected to `/auth/callback`

3. **Auth Callback Check**
   - Checks if user has completed onboarding
   - If not, redirects to `/onboarding`

4. **Dashboard Access Attempt**
   - If user tries to access dashboard before onboarding
   - API returns 400 "Setup required"
   - Frontend auto-redirects to `/onboarding`

5. **Complete Onboarding**
   - User completes onboarding steps
   - Organization created
   - `has_completed_onboarding` set to true
   - Can now access dashboard

## Testing Verification

Created test script at `scripts/test-onboarding.ts` that verifies:
- User exists in database
- Onboarding status is correctly set
- Organization membership status
- Dashboard API behavior

## Next Steps for New Users

1. Sign up with email/Google
2. Will be automatically redirected to `/onboarding`
3. Complete onboarding to create organization
4. Access dashboard normally after completion

The app is running on http://localhost:3001 and the onboarding flow is now working correctly.
