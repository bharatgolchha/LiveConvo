# Team Tab Lock Implementation Summary

## Feature Implemented
The Teams tab in Settings is now locked for users on the free plan, requiring a Pro or Team subscription to access team collaboration features.

## Changes Made

### 1. SettingsPanel Component (`/components/settings/SettingsPanel.tsx`)
- Added `useSubscription` hook to detect user's plan type
- Added logic to check if user is on free plan (`isTeamLocked`)
- Implemented controlled tabs state with `handleTabChange` function
- Prevents navigation to team tab when on free plan
- Redirects to subscription tab if free user tries to access team via URL

### 2. Team Tab UI Changes
- **Visual Indicator**: Lock icon replaces Users icon when locked
- **Disabled State**: Tab appears with reduced opacity and cursor-not-allowed
- **Tooltip**: Shows "Team features are available on Pro and Team plans" on hover
- **Locked Content**: Shows a dedicated locked screen with:
  - Lock icon
  - Clear messaging about upgrade requirement
  - "View Upgrade Options" button that navigates to Billing tab

### 3. Subscription Hook Update (`/lib/hooks/useSubscription.ts`)
- Updated plan type detection logic to properly identify:
  - `individual_free` → 'free'
  - `pro`, `starter`, `max` → 'pro'
  - `team` → 'team'

## User Experience

### For Free Plan Users
1. Team tab shows with lock icon and disabled appearance
2. Clicking the tab does nothing (prevented by disabled state)
3. Hovering shows tooltip explaining upgrade requirement
4. If somehow accessed, shows locked content screen with upgrade prompt
5. URL attempts to access team tab redirect to subscription tab

### For Pro/Team Plan Users
1. Team tab shows normally with Users icon
2. Full access to team management features
3. Can invite members, manage team, etc.

## Testing
- Test with free plan user: `bgolchha+p1@gmail.com` (individual_free plan)
- Team tab should appear locked
- Clicking should not navigate to team content
- URL access (e.g., `#team`) should redirect to subscription tab

## Implementation Benefits
1. **Clear Value Proposition**: Shows users what features require upgrade
2. **Non-intrusive**: Doesn't hide the tab, just locks it
3. **Informative**: Clear messaging about why it's locked
4. **Easy Upgrade Path**: Direct link to billing/subscription page
5. **Consistent UX**: Uses existing UI patterns and components

## Next Steps
- Monitor user engagement with locked tab
- Consider A/B testing different lock messaging
- Track conversion rate from locked tab to upgrades
