# Progress Indicator Fix Summary

## Issues Found:
1. Progress only showed when tldr had a specific string value
2. SSE stream buffer handling needed improvement
3. Progress indicators were showing when summary already exists

## Changes Made:

### 1. TabbedReport.tsx
- Changed condition from checking specific tldr text to checking `finalizing || finalizationProgress`
- Always show ReportGenerationProgress when finalizing

### 2. page.tsx (Report page)
- Added buffer handling for SSE stream to handle partial chunks
- Added `regenerate: true` flag when manually finalizing
- Added console logging for debugging

### 3. finalize/route.ts
- Updated progress values to be sequential (1, 2, 3... 8)
- Added console logging for SSE requests

## Testing Steps:
1. Go to a report page where summary is pending
2. Click "Generate Summary Now"
3. You should see progress updates in real-time
4. Check browser console for progress logs

## Next Steps if Still Not Working:
1. Check browser console for any errors
2. Verify the session has transcript data
3. Ensure authentication is working properly
4. Test with the /test-sse page created
