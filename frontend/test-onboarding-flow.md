# Onboarding Flow Test Results

## Issue Fixed
The dashboard API was returning a 400 error "Please complete onboarding first" for new users, which wasn't being handled properly by the frontend.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard API (`/api/dashboard/data/route.ts`)
- Added explicit check for `has_completed_onboarding` flag
- Returns proper 400 error with "Setup required" message if user hasn't completed onboarding

### 2. Dashboard Data Hook (`useDashboardData.ts`)
- Added handler for 400 status with "Setup required" error
- Automatically redirects to `/onboarding` when this error is encountered

### 3. Auth Callback (`/auth/callback/page.tsx`)
- Already properly handles redirect to `/onboarding` for new users
- Has retry logic to handle database trigger race conditions
- Falls back to creating user record if trigger fails

## Flow After Fix

1. **New User Signs Up** → User record created with `has_completed_onboarding: false`
2. **Email Verification** → User redirected to `/auth/callback`
3. **Auth Callback** → Checks `has_completed_onboarding` flag
4. **Redirect to Onboarding** → Since flag is false, redirects to `/onboarding`
5. **If User Tries Dashboard** → Dashboard API returns 400, frontend redirects to `/onboarding`
6. **Complete Onboarding** → Flag set to true, user can access dashboard

## Testing Steps

1. Sign up with a new email
2. Verify email (if using email signup)
3. Should be redirected to `/onboarding` automatically
4. Complete onboarding steps
5. Should be able to access dashboard after completion

## Edge Cases Handled

- Database trigger failure (fallback user creation)
- Race conditions (retry logic)
- Direct dashboard access (auto-redirect to onboarding)
- Google OAuth signup (same flow as email)
