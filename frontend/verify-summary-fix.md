# Summary Generation Fix Verification

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced JSON Parsing**:
   - Added handling for markdown code blocks (```json) that the AI sometimes includes
   - Improved extraction of JSON from mixed content
   - Better error handling with multiple fallback strategies

2. **Improved Logging**:
   - Added detailed request/response logging
   - Shows full AI response content for debugging
   - Tracks parsing success/failure with details

3. **Simplified Prompts**:
   - Removed overly complex prompt instructions
   - Made the system prompt clearer and more direct
   - Simplified user prompt to avoid confusion

## Test Results

‚úÖ **Direct API Test**: Successfully generates proper summaries with meaningful content
‚úÖ **JSON Parsing**: Handles both raw JSON and markdown-wrapped JSON responses
‚úÖ **Error Recovery**: Falls back gracefully when parsing fails

## Example Working Response

```json
{
  "tldr": "The quarterly sales report showed a 15% revenue increase, primarily driven by the new product line and improved customer retention, leading to a decision to invest more in the new product line and a commitment to prepare an expansion proposal.",
  "keyPoints": [
    "15% increase in revenue this quarter.",
    "New product line contributed 60% of the growth.",
    "Improved customer retention added 25% to growth.",
    "Agreement to invest more in the new product line.",
    "Proposal for expanding the product line to be prepared by next week."
  ],
  "decisions": ["To invest more in the new product line."],
  "actionItems": ["Speaker 2 to prepare a proposal for expanding the product line by next week."],
  "nextSteps": ["Preparation of a proposal for expanding the new product line."],
  "topics": ["Quarterly sales report", "Revenue growth drivers", "New product line investment", "Customer retention impact"],
  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "progressStatus": "building_momentum"
}
```

## Monitoring

Check the console logs while using the app to see:
- üöÄ Summary API Request
- üì§ Sending to OpenRouter
- ü§ñ OpenRouter Full Response
- üìù AI Raw Content
- ‚úÖ Successfully parsed JSON (or üí• JSON Parse Error with details)

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the application during actual use
2. Check if summaries are now showing meaningful content instead of generic fallbacks
3. Verify that the checklist recommendations are being generated properly
4. Test with various conversation types and lengths
