# Meeting Page Responsive Design Summary

## Overview
The meeting page has been completely redesigned to provide an intuitive and functional experience across all device sizes, with special attention to mobile usability.

## Key Mobile Features

### 1. **Mobile Layout Architecture** ✅
- **Split View**: On mobile, users see either the conversation OR AI advisor, not both
- **View Toggle**: Fixed bottom navigation with clear toggle buttons
- **Full Screen Usage**: Each view takes full screen for maximum content visibility

### 2. **Mobile Navigation Controls** ✅
- **Conversation/AI Toggle**: Two prominent buttons at bottom of screen
  - "Conversation" button with chat icon
  - "AI Advisor" button with sparkles icon
- **Active State**: Clear visual indicator showing current view
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large tap targets (minimum 44px)

### 3. **Responsive Meeting Header** ✅
- **Compact Design**: Smaller padding and font sizes on mobile
- **Smart Hiding**: Less critical elements (theme toggle, bot controls) hidden on mobile
- **Essential Info**: Meeting title, platform icon, and status always visible
- **Touch-Optimized**: Larger touch targets for back button and actions

### 4. **Mobile Conversation Tabs** ✅
- **Horizontal Scrolling**: Tabs scroll horizontally on mobile
- **Active Tab Centering**: Current tab auto-scrolls to center
- **Compact Labels**: Shorter tab names on mobile (e.g., "Transcript" instead of "Live Transcript")
- **Visual Indicators**: Badges and indicators remain visible

### 5. **AI Advisor Bottom Sheet** ✅
- **Bottom Sheet Pattern**: AI Advisor slides up from bottom on mobile
- **80% Height**: Takes up 80vh for good visibility while showing context
- **Drag Handle**: Visual indicator at top for potential drag-to-dismiss
- **Full Tab Labels**: All tabs show labels on mobile for clarity

## Responsive Breakpoints

### Mobile (<768px)
- Single view (Conversation OR AI Advisor)

- Horizontal scrolling tabs
- Compact header
- Touch-optimized controls

- Similar to mobile but with more spacing
- Some desktop features start appearing
- Better use of available space

### Desktop (>1024px)

## Implementation Details

### Custom Hook: `useMediaQuery`
```typescript
// Detects screen size for responsive behavior
useIsMobile() // Returns true for screens < 768px
useIsTablet() // Returns true for 768px - 1024px
useIsDesktop() // Returns true for > 1024px
```
