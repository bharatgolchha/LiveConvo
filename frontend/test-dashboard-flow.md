# Test Dashboard to Conversation Flow

## Test Steps:

### 1. Dashboard - Session Card Click
- [x] Go to Dashboard
- [x] Session cards should be clickable (wrapped in div with onClick)
- [x] Clicking on a completed session should navigate to `/app?cid={sessionId}`

### 2. Conversation Page - Loading Finalized Session
- [x] When loading with `?cid={sessionId}`, the app should:
  - Load session details from backend
  - Set conversation state to 'completed' for finalized sessions
  - Load the session transcript if available
  - Show the conversation title and type

### 3. View Final Summary Button
- [x] For completed sessions, there should be a "View Final Summary" button
- [x] Button should be visible in the header next to "New Session"
- [x] Clicking the button should navigate to `/summary/{sessionId}`

### 4. AI Chat Functionality
- [x] AI Coach sidebar should remain functional for completed sessions
- [x] Users can still ask questions about the completed conversation
- [x] Chat input and send functionality should work normally

## Implementation Summary:

1. **Dashboard Changes:**
   - Added onClick wrapper to session cards that calls `handleResumeSession()`
   - This navigates to `/app?cid={sessionId}` for any session (active or completed)

2. **Conversation Page Changes:**
   - Added `loadSessionDetails()` function to fetch session data from backend
   - Added `loadSessionTranscript()` function to load transcript for completed sessions
   - These are called when no localStorage state exists but conversationId is present
   - Added "View Final Summary" button for completed sessions in the header

3. **AI Coach Sidebar:**
   - Already supports chat for completed sessions (no changes needed)
   - Input remains active regardless of conversation state

## What Works Now:

- ✅ Click any session in dashboard to view it
- ✅ Completed sessions load with their transcript and summary
- ✅ "View Final Summary" button appears for completed sessions
- ✅ AI chat works for asking questions about completed sessions
- ✅ Navigation flow: Dashboard → Conversation → Summary
