# App Page Refactoring Progress

## Completed Steps

### Phase 1: Extract Utility Functions ✅
1. **Format Utilities** (`src/lib/conversation/formatUtils.ts`)
   - Extracted `formatDuration` function
   - All tests passing

2. **Database Operations** (`src/lib/conversation/databaseOperations.ts`)
   - Extracted `saveTranscriptToDatabase`
   - Extracted `saveTranscriptNow`
   - Extracted `saveSummaryToDatabase`
   - All tests passing

3. **State Utilities** (`src/lib/conversation/stateUtils.ts`)
   - Extracted `getStateTextAndColor`
   - Extracted `PROCESSING_ANIMATION_DURATION` constant
   - All tests passing

### Phase 2: Extract Custom Hooks ✅

1. **Recording State Hook** (`src/lib/hooks/conversation/useRecordingState.ts`) ✅
   - Manages recording start time, session duration, and cumulative duration
   - Handles timer logic for tracking recording time
   - Includes reset functionality
   - All 6 tests passing
   - Running in parallel with existing state

2. **Transcript Manager Hook** (`src/lib/hooks/conversation/useTranscriptManager.ts`) ✅
   - Manages transcript array and save index
   - Handles live transcript additions
   - Implements periodic auto-save (45 seconds)
   - Implements high-activity save (20+ lines)
   - Includes cleanup on unmount
   - All 9 tests passing
   - Running in parallel with existing state

3. **Conversation Session Hook** (`src/lib/hooks/conversation/useConversationSession.ts`) ✅
   - Manages session data loading from backend
   - Handles transcript loading from database
   - Maps conversation types from DB format
   - Manages loading states
   - All 9 tests passing
   - Running in parallel with existing state

4. **Conversation UI Hook** (`src/lib/hooks/conversation/useConversationUI.ts`) ✅
   - Manages all UI visibility states (panels, modals, fullscreen)
   - Handles active tab state
   - Manages AI Coach sidebar width
   - Tracks search filters and error messages
   - Includes reset functionality
   - All 8 tests passing
   - Running in parallel with existing state

5. **Conversation Handlers Hook** (`src/lib/hooks/conversation/useConversationHandlers.ts`) ✅
   - Consolidates all action handlers (recording, file upload, export, etc.)
   - Manages recording lifecycle (start, stop, pause, resume)
   - Handles file operations and context saving
   - Implements export and finalization logic
   - Includes session reset functionality
   - All 15 tests passing
   - Running in parallel with existing handlers

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Extract Components
1. Create header components (ConversationHeader with sub-components)
2. Extract state display components (Setup, Ready, Recording, Processing, Completed)
3. Create layout components (ConversationLayout with sidebars)
4. Consolidate modal management

### Phase 4: Implement Context
1. Create ConversationContext structure
2. Migrate state from hooks to context
3. Remove prop drilling
4. Integrate all hooks into context provider

### Testing Status
- All existing functionality preserved
- No regression in app behavior
- Hooks running in parallel for safety
- Total tests added: 47 (all passing)
  - Format utilities: 3 tests
  - Recording state hook: 6 tests
  - Transcript manager hook: 9 tests
  - Session hook: 9 tests
  - UI hook: 8 tests
  - Handlers hook: 15 tests

## Architecture Benefits So Far
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Logic is being extracted into focused, reusable hooks
2. **Testability**: Each hook has comprehensive unit tests
3. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and modify
4. **Type Safety**: All hooks are fully typed with TypeScript
5. **Performance**: No degradation, hooks use proper React optimization patterns

## Notes
- All hooks are currently running in parallel with the original state to ensure no functionality is lost
- The app page still contains the original logic, allowing for gradual migration
- No breaking changes have been introduced
- The refactoring is following the incremental approach as planned
